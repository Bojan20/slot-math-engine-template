"""W244 wave 13 — closed-form analytical model for `pick_chain` features.

Industry pattern (multi-level pick bonus, Microgaming Mega Moolah pick-pot,
NetEnt "Hall of Spins" tier wheel, Aristocrat "Mighty Cash" pick chain):

  Pick chain dynamics
  -------------------
    Player enters a pick screen with N options. Each option reveals
    either a CREDIT award (value × bet) or a NEXT-LEVEL token. The
    bonus terminates when:
      (a) a "collect" / "end" symbol is revealed, OR
      (b) max_levels reached, OR
      (c) all picks on the current level have been chosen.

    Each level can have its own pick pool (number of options) and
    award table. Levels typically escalate — higher level = larger
    awards but smaller probability of advancing.

  Closed-form RTP contribution
  ----------------------------
    For a single trigger:

      E[total_award | trigger] = sum_over_levels(
          P(reach level L) × E[award per pick at L] × E[picks at L]
      )

    where P(reach level L) is the product over levels < L of the
    "advance probability" for that level.

  Per-spin RTP
  ------------
    RTP[pick_chain] = trigger_p × E[total_award | trigger]

    Level L+1 is reached only if level L issued an advance token before

    multiple picks per level can fire either token. Simplified rule:
    if ANY of E[picks] picks at this level reveals an advance token,
